# Official Rules (June 2017)

## League Play

### Weekly Matches
      
Matches are scheduled Monday through Friday nights each week of a season. Active teams will receive 1 series with evenly matched opponents each week. Schedules come out the Friday before each week. Matches that are not completed on the website by the time the scheduler runs will be deleted. A team can turn off their schedules at any time. To do so, [visit your team's leagues page](account_team_leagues_path). It can be turned back on when your team is ready to be scheduled again.

### Substitutions

Matches require 4/5 players from your team to check in before each round can start. This allows your team so sub one player not from your team. The substition should follow division rules.

Substitutions can occur between rounds. A player who plays the first round is not required to play any more rounds during that match.

You may not substitute players during draft. Once drafting has begun, the roster is locked. Beware, Abathur mains.

### Team Schedules

Teams are matched by rating and time available. [Team's can manage their preferred schedules here.](account_team_schedule_path) Currently, Chair League requires teams to select at least 3 days of the week they would prefer to play on. This is so we can guarantee there is a time both teams would be willing to play at.
      
### Team Timezones

Teams select timezones to play at. By default, timezones for all teams are Central Time. Timezones are used for both recruiting players and matchmaking.

- **Select Eeastern Time** if you want to play earlier in the night. (EST, INDIANA)
- **Select Central Time** if you want to play in the middle of the night.
- **Select Pacific Time** if you want to play later in the night. (PST, MST, ALASKA, HAWAII, ARIZONA)

### Rescheduling

Matches can be rescheduled between two teams. If a team will not be able to make the scheduled match time, they may submit a reschedule request to the other team. Reschedule requests can be found when viewing your match inside of your /account/team/matches page. Reschedule requests must be submitted before the proposed time. Reschedule requests do not need to be accepted by the other team, but it would be nice if the opposing team considered it. If no new time can be agreed upon, the original match time is the official start time.

## Divisions

### Selecting a Division

Each league consists of many divisions. Chair League divisions vary in competitiveness. When signing up for a season, divisions will be ordered by most competitive to least competitive. Choose a division not based on indivudual skill, but by skill as a team. Currently, there is no way to change divisions mid-season.

### Standings
      
Division standings are ordered by points. Teams earn points only in their weekly division match. Wins will reward +3 points while losses will not reward any points.

### Season Rating

During season play, team's will acquire a seasonal rating. This can be viewed in the standing of the division. The rating represents how a team is doing relative to other teams. Higher ratings show higher performance. Chair League uses this rating to match your team against opponents of similar skill level within your division. Rating gained or loss depends on the outcome of the weekly match and the magnitude is related to the rating difference between the two teams.

## Tournaments

### Divisions

Tournaments are separated by divisions. When a team joins a tournament, they will be joined by teams in the same division.

### Seeding

Tournament seeds are determined upon team rating. Tie-breakers are broken by who signed up first for the tournament.

### Rewards

Rewards in tournaments unlock as more teams sign up. The rewards that can be earned from a tournament will differ based on the competitiveness, or division, of the tournament. More rewards will be given to Pro Division teams than in Division 3.

When teams earn rewards, the players who participated in the tournament are the only ones who are granted rewards. Those players can [redeem their prizes in their account](account_prizes_path).

## Matches

### Home Team

Responsible for hosting the match and inviting everyone.

### Drafting

We will be using in-game draft tool for drafts.

### Tardy Policy

Teams who do not show up can be marked as no-shows after 10 minutes. If you are in contact with their team, give them some sportsmanlike leeway. At the same time, everyone's time should be respected and not wasted. You can report no shows on the match page within your team's management view. Report no shows as fair as possible.

### Reporting

After the match finishes, either team can return to the match page and record the winner.

If the match is recorded incorrectly, please contact paul@superjova.com to get it undone.

## Teams

### Leagues

Teams can play in multiple leagues at the same time without creating a new squad. Your team can play in both the Tuesday and Thursday night leagues if you find yourself that hungry for some Chair League.

### Roster Cap

Teams have an 8 player roster cap. This adds a responsibility of keeping an active roster to managing your team. Roster caps also make competition easier as you now can see who you may be playing when matched each week with an opponent.

### Expected Behavior

Chair League is a recreational league and expects its players to behave accordingly. At the end of the day, we want to create a fun and positive environment to play in. Sportmanship is expected on and off the court. If you do happen to get triggered, grab the nearest pillow and scream into it. Take a deep breath. There's always next week.

Teams that repeatedly act disrespectful will be disbanded. There really is no reason for it. Buy more pillows.

### Battle.net

Chair League recommends you to add your Battle.net to your account. [Add your Battle.net to your account here](account_contact_methods_path). It's required to join a team.

It is important to note that you should have at least one Battle.net handle attached to your account. Players need this information in order for players to invite each other to matches. Your Battle.net tag will be displayed publicly on Chair League.

## Format

Teams play a best of 3 series against an evenly matched opponent each week on the chosen league night.

### Scheduling
      
Match schedules are released the Friday before each week. A team can disable match scheduling at any time by [visiting your team's leagues page](https://www.chairleague.com/account/teams). Scheduling can be reenabled whenever your team is ready to play again.

Be aware that **matches that are not recorded on the website by the time the scheduler runs will be deleted, so make sure to [post your results](#results)** promptly! Additionally, if there is an odd number of teams in a division on a certain week, one team will have a bye for that week.

### Divisions

Each league consists of several divisions with varying levels of competitiveness. Division 1 has the highest level of competition, followed by Division 2 and then Division 3. Teams may choose which division to compete in. Currently, there is no way to change divisions mid-season. Division choice should be based not on individual skill, but rather by strength as a team. That said, the rough breakdown of ranks in each division is:

- Players in Division 1 tend to be Diamond or higher
- Players in Division 2 tend to be between Gold and Diamond
- Players in Division 3 tend to be between Bronze and Platinum

Players who have achieved Master or higher in any Hero or Team League season are ineligible to compete in Division 3. Aside from this restriction, all divisions are open to anyone.

### Map Pool

Chair League establishes a map pool for each season. The map pool for Season 1 of Tuesday/Thursday Night Heroes includes the following maps:

- Battlefield of Eternity
- Braxis Holdout
- Cursed Hollow
- Dragon Shire
- Infernal Shrines
- Sky Temple
- Tomb of the Spider Queen
- Towers of Doom
- Warhead Junction

[View Map Pool Here](https://www.chairleague.com/maps/enabled).

### Hero Status

Generally, only heroes with significant bugs are banned, at Chair League's discretion. Heroes are available upon release.

### Pricing

Entry into a league costs $3 per week of regular season play per team, regardless of roster size. Playing the full season costs $24; teams joining late pay only for the weeks remaining in the season. Additionally, if a team has a bye for a week, they will be refunded one week's fee.

## Matches

### Check-in

Four or five players from your team must check in on the match page for each round before the round can start. 

### Tardy Policy

Teams who are not ready to play 10 minutes after the scheduled start time can be marked as no-shows. However, if you are waiting on and in contact with your opponents, please give them some sportsmanlike leeway. Likewise, please respect your opponents' and the caster's time. You can report no shows on the match page within your team's management view.

### Casters

If a match is being casted, the caster(s) should be added to the lobby and set to "referee" status. 

### Substitutions

Teams may sub in one non-rostered player for games, so long as that player is eligible to play in that league (see [Divisions](#divisions) and [Playing in Multiple Leagues](#playing-in-multiple-leagues-teams)). Substitutions can occur in between rounds - player who plays in any round is not required to play in any other rounds in the series. However, once drafting has begun, the roster is locked for that round.

### Map Selection / Draft Order

The Home team, as designated by the schedule, is responsible for selecting the map and hosting the lobby for the first match. The Away team will thus have the first pick in the draft. This then alternates each round, as such:

- Game 1: Home team selects map, Away team has first draft pick.
- Game 2: Away team selects map, Home team has first draft pick.
- Game 3: Home team selects map, Away team has first draft pick.

The map selected must be from the [map pool](#map-pool) for the season. Each map may only be played once per series.

### Drafting

Use the in-game draft tool, set to tournament draft mode, for drafting.

### Results

After the match finishes, either team can return to the match page and record the winner.

If the match is recorded incorrectly, please contact paul@superjova.com to get it corrected.

## Seasons

Seasons consist of 8 weeks of regular season play followed by playoffs for each division. Teams may continue to sign up at any point up until the end of the 6th week of play.

### Standings
      
Division standings are determined by points, earned by winning regular season matches. Wins reward 3 points while losses reward no points.

### Roster Changes

Roster changes may be made up until the 6th week of regular season play. After that point, rosters will be locked and team registration will close.

### Playoff Seeding

Playoffs seeds are determined upon [team rating](#rating). Tie-breakers are broken by who signed up first for the tournament.

### Prizes

Success in a season may award prizes to teams. More prizes will be available as more teams sign up. Prizing will differ between divisions, with more rewards going to Division 1 than Division 2 and more going to Division 2 than Division 3.

Only players who participated in the playoffs are granted prizes. Those players can [redeem their prizes in their account page](account_prizes_path).

## Teams

### Roster Limits

Teams must have at least five and at most eight rostered members in order to participate in a league.

### Timezones

Teams select timezones to play in. By default, timezones for all teams are Central Time.

- **Select Eastern Time** if you want to play earlier in the evening. (EST, INDIANA)
- **Select Central Time** if you want to play in the middle of the evening.
- **Select Pacific Time** if you want to play later in the evening. (PST, MST, ALASKA, HAWAII, ARIZONA)

### Team Rating

During season play, teams acquire a rating that represents how they are doing relative to other teams, with higher rating indicating stronger performance. This rating is used to match teams against opponents of similar skill within the division. Rating increases with match wins and decreases with losses; the magnitude of change is dependent on the difference between the two teams' ratings. Rating can be viewed on a team's profile page. 

### Battle.net

In order to join a team, players must add their Battle.net tags to their accounts. Tags are displayed publicly on the Chair League site. [Add your Battle.net tag to your account here](https://www.chairleague.com/account/user/contact_methods).

### Playing in Multiple Leagues / Teams

Teams can play in multiple leagues in a season with the same roster. Moreover, players may join and play on multiple teams, provided the teams are in different leagues and/or divisions.

A player who is playing in a league cannot join or sub for another team in the same league.

### Expected Behavior

Chair League is a recreational league and expects its players to behave accordingly. Sportmanship is expected both ingame and out. Teams that repeatedly act disrespectful will be disbanded at Chair League's discretion.

# Official Rules

As of June 2017

## League Play

### Weekly Matches
      
Pick the available night of the week for your team to compete.  Whether you throw down on Thursday or take up arms on Tuesday, active teams will receive 1 series with evenly matched opponents each week on your chosen night. Schedules come out the Friday before each week. Matches that are not completed on the website by the time the scheduler runs will be deleted, so make sure to post your results! A team can turn off their schedules at any time. To do so, [visit your team's leagues page](https://www.chairleague.com/account/teams). It can be turned back on when your team is ready to be scheduled again.

### Competitive Map Pool

Chairleague seeks to give you a fully immersive competitive experience.  To add to that only the most competitive maps are available for play, sorry Garden of Terror...  

Each season a map pool will be established by the League.  For Season 1 of Tuesday/Thursday Night Heroes the map pool includes the following maps:

- Battlefield of Eternity
- Braxis Holdout
- Cursed Hollow
- Dragon Shire
- Infernal Shrines
- Sky Temple
- Tomb of the Spider Queen
- Towers of Doom
- Warhead Junction

[View Map Pool Here](https://www.chairleague.com/maps/enabled)

Each map may only be played (1) time per series.

Study up, hone your strats, and be ready to throw down on these battlefeilds during your preferred night of Chairleague action.

### Substitutions

Matches require 4/5 players from your team to check in before each round can start. This allows your team so sub one player not from your team. The substition should follow division rules.

Substitutions can occur between rounds. A player who plays the first round is not required to play any more rounds during that match.

You may not substitute players during draft. Once drafting has begun, the roster is locked. Beware, Abathur mains.
      
### Team Timezones

Teams select timezones to play at. By default, timezones for all teams are Central Time. Timezones are used for both recruiting players and matchmaking.

- **Select Eeastern Time** if you want to play earlier in the night. (EST, INDIANA)
- **Select Central Time** if you want to play in the middle of the night.
- **Select Pacific Time** if you want to play later in the night. (PST, MST, ALASKA, HAWAII, ARIZONA)

### Rescheduling

Matches can be rescheduled between two teams. If a team will not be able to make the scheduled match time, they may submit a reschedule request to the other team. Reschedule requests can be found when viewing your match inside of your /account/team/matches page. Reschedule requests must be submitted before the proposed time. Reschedule requests do not need to be accepted by the other team, but it would be nice if the opposing team considered it. If no new time can be agreed upon, the original match time is the official start time.

## Divisions

### Selecting a Division

Each league consists of many divisions. Chair League divisions vary in competitiveness. When signing up for a season, divisions will be ordered by most competitive to least competitive. Choose a division not based on indivudual skill, but by skill as a team. Currently, there is no way to change divisions mid-season.

All divisions are open to anyone. However, there is a restriction on Division 3. **If you have ever been ranked Masters or higher during any Hero or Team League season, you are not allowed to compete in Division 3.**

### Standings
      
Division standings are ordered by points. Teams earn points only in their weekly division match. Wins will reward +3 points while losses will not reward any points.

### Season Rating

During season play, team's will acquire a seasonal rating. This can be viewed in the standing of the division. The rating represents how a team is doing relative to other teams. Higher ratings show higher performance. Chair League uses this rating to match your team against opponents of similar skill level within your division. Rating gained or loss depends on the outcome of the weekly match and the magnitude is related to the rating difference between the two teams.

## Tournaments

### Divisions

Tournaments are separated by divisions. When a team joins a tournament, they will be joined by teams in the same division.

### Seeding

Tournament seeds are determined upon team rating. Tie-breakers are broken by who signed up first for the tournament.

### Rewards

Rewards in tournaments unlock as more teams sign up. The rewards that can be earned from a tournament will differ based on the competitiveness, or division, of the tournament. More rewards will be given to Pro Division teams than in Division 3.

When teams earn rewards, the players who participated in the tournament are the only ones who are granted rewards. Those players can [redeem their prizes in their account](account_prizes_path).

## Matches

### Home Team

Responsible for hosting the match and inviting everyone.  If the match is being cast by a Chairleage caster, that caster will be an observer in the lobby and be set to "referee" status in the game lobby. 

### Map Selection

As each match is Best of 3 format, one team will have to select the initial battlefeild for the two teams to clash.  The Visiting team, as designated by the schecule, will be responsible for selecting the first map of the match.  To keep things balanced, the team that selects the map will have the second position during the draft, banning and picking second.  The map selected must be a map from that season's map pool.  Also let's not get too repetitive here, once a map cannot be selected if it has already been selected during the match--this isn't some other moba after all... 

### Drafting

We will be using in-game draft tool, set to tournament draft mode, for drafts.

### Tardy Policy

Teams who do not show up can be marked as no-shows after 10 minutes. If you are in contact with their team, give them some sportsmanlike leeway. At the same time, everyone's time should be respected and not wasted. You can report no shows on the match page within your team's management view. Report no shows as fair as possible.

### Reporting

After the match finishes, either team can return to the match page and record the winner.

If the match is recorded incorrectly, please contact paul@superjova.com to get it undone.

## Teams

### Leagues

Teams can play in multiple leagues at the same time without creating a new squad. Your team can play in both the Tuesday and Thursday night leagues if you find yourself that hungry for some Chair League.

### Roster Cap

Teams have an 8 player roster cap. This adds a responsibility of keeping an active roster to managing your team. Roster caps also make competition easier as you now can see who you may be playing when matched each week with an opponent.

### Expected Behavior

Chair League is a recreational league and expects its players to behave accordingly. At the end of the day, we want to create a fun and positive environment to play in. Sportmanship is expected on and off the court. If you do happen to get triggered, grab the nearest pillow and scream into it. Take a deep breath. There's always next week.

Teams that repeatedly act disrespectful will be disbanded. There really is no reason for it. Buy more pillows.

### Battle.net

Chair League recommends you to add your Battle.net to your account. [Add your Battle.net to your account here](https://www.chairleague.com/account/contact_methods). It's required to join a team.

It is important to note that you should have at least one Battle.net handle attached to your account. Players need this information in order for players to invite each other to matches. Your Battle.net tag will be displayed publicly on Chair League.

## Heroes

### Status

## League Play

### Weekly Matches
      
Pick the available night of the week for your team to compete.  Whether you throw down on Thursday or take up arms on Tuesday, active teams will play a best of 3 series against an evenly matched opponent each week on the chosen night. Schedules come out the Friday before each week. Matches that are not completed on the website by the time the scheduler runs will be deleted, so make sure to post your results! A team can disable match scheduling at any time by [visiting your team's leagues page](https://www.chairleague.com/account/teams). Scheduling can be reenabled whenever your team is ready to play again.

### Competitive Map Pool

Chair League seeks to give you a fully immersive competitive experience.  To add to that only the most competitive maps are available for play, sorry Garden of Terror...  

The league establishes a map pool for each season. The map pool for Season 1 of Tuesday/Thursday Night Heroes includes the following maps:

- Battlefield of Eternity
- Braxis Holdout
- Cursed Hollow
- Dragon Shire
- Infernal Shrines
- Sky Temple
- Tomb of the Spider Queen
- Towers of Doom
- Warhead Junction

[View Map Pool Here](https://www.chairleague.com/maps/enabled)

Study up, hone your strats, and be ready to throw down on these battlefields on your preferred night of Chair League action.

### Substitutions

Matches require four or five players from your team to check in before each round can start. Teams may sub in one non-rostered player, so long as that player is eligible to play in that league (see [Player on Multiple Teams](#player-on-multiple-teams) and [Selecting a Division](#selecting-a-division)).

Substitutions can occur in between rounds. A player who plays in any round is not required to play in any other rounds in the series. 

Substitutions may not happen during or after draft. Once drafting has begun, the roster is locked. Beware, Abathur mains.

### Player on Multiple Teams

Players can join and play on multiple teams in different divisions.

A player who is playing in a league cannot join or sub for another team in the same league.
      
### Team Timezones

Teams select timezones to play in. By default, timezones for all teams are Central Time.

- **Select Eastern Time** if you want to play earlier in the evening. (EST, INDIANA)
- **Select Central Time** if you want to play in the middle of the evening.
- **Select Pacific Time** if you want to play later in the evening. (PST, MST, ALASKA, HAWAII, ARIZONA)

## Divisions

### Selecting a Division

Each league consists of many divisions, ordered by competitiveness, with Division 1 having the highest level of competition. Choose a division not based on indivudual skill, but by skill as a team. Currently, there is no way to change divisions mid-season.

**Players who have achieved Master or higher in any Hero or Team League season are ineligible to compete in Division 3.** Aside from this restriction, all divisions are open to anyone.

### Standings
      
Division standings are ordered by points. Teams earn points only in their weekly division match. Wins will reward +3 points while losses will not reward any points.

### Season Rating

During season play, team's will acquire a seasonal rating. This can be viewed in the standing of the division. The rating represents how a team is doing relative to other teams. Higher ratings show higher performance. Chair League uses this rating to match your team against opponents of similar skill level within your division. Rating gained or loss depends on the outcome of the weekly match and the magnitude is related to the rating difference between the two teams.

## Tournaments

### Divisions

Tournaments are separated by divisions. When a team joins a tournament, they will be joined by teams in the same division.

### Seeding

Tournament seeds are determined upon team rating. Tie-breakers are broken by who signed up first for the tournament.

### Rewards

Rewards in tournaments unlock as more teams sign up. The rewards that can be earned from a tournament will differ based on the competitiveness, or division, of the tournament. More rewards will be given to Division 1 teams than Division 3 teams.

Only players who participated in a tournament are granted rewards for that tournament. Those players can [redeem their prizes in their account page](account_prizes_path).

## Matches

### Home Team

The Home team is responsible for hosting the match and inviting everyone.  If the match is being casted, that caster should be added to the lobby as an observer and set to "referee" status. 

### Map Selection

As each match is Best of 3 format, one team will have to select the initial battlefield for the two teams to clash.  The Home team, as designated by the schedule, will be responsible for selecting the first map of the match. The Away team will thus have the first pick in the draft. This then alternates each game, as such:

- Game 1: Home Team selects Map, Visiting Team has first Draft pick.
- Game 2: Visiting Team selects Map, Home Team has first Draft pick.
- Game 3: Home Team selects Map, Visiting Team has First Draft pick.

The map selected must be from the [map pool](#competitive-map-pool) for the season. Each map may only be played once per series. 

### Drafting

Use the in-game draft tool, set to tournament draft mode, for drafting.

### Tardy Policy

Teams who do not show up can be marked as no-shows after 10 minutes. If you are in contact with their team, give them some sportsmanlike leeway. At the same time, everyone's time should be respected and not wasted. You can report no shows on the match page within your team's management view. Report no shows as fair as possible.

### Reporting

After the match finishes, either team can return to the match page and record the winner.

If the match is recorded incorrectly, please contact paul@superjova.com to get it undone.

## Teams

### Leagues

Teams can play in multiple leagues at the same time without creating a new squad. Your team can play in both the Tuesday and Thursday night leagues if you find yourself that hungry for some Chair League.

### Roster Cap

Teams have an 8 player roster cap. This adds a responsibility of keeping an active roster to managing your team. Roster caps also make competition easier as you now can see who you may be playing when matched each week with an opponent.

### Expected Behavior

Chair League is a recreational league and expects its players to behave accordingly. At the end of the day, we want to create a fun and positive environment to play in. Sportmanship is expected both ingame and out. Teams that repeatedly act disrespectful will be disbanded.

### Battle.net

Players must add their Battle.net tags to their accounts in order to join a team. Tags are displayed publicly on the Chair League site. [Add your Battle.net tag to your account here](https://www.chairleague.com/account/contact_methods).

## Heroes

### Status

Generally, only heroes with game breaking bugs are banned. Heroes are available upon release. [View Hero Status here](https://www.chairleague.com/heroes/enabled).
